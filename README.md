# Checkers Game (WPF)

This is a simple Checkers (Draughts) game implemented using C# and WPF. The game allows two players to play checkers on a standard 8x8 board, with rules for moving pieces, capturing opponents' pieces, and promoting pieces to kings when they reach the last row.

## Features:
- **Dynamic Board Creation**: The board is dynamically generated with 8x8 squares.
- **Piece Movement**: Players can move their pieces based on the standard rules of checkers (one square diagonally, capturing by jumping over an opponent's piece).
- **King Promotion**: Pieces are promoted to kings when they reach the last row. Kings can move both forward and backward.
- **Turn-based Gameplay**: The game alternates turns between the black and white pieces.
- **AI Hint System (Partially Implemented)**: There is a placeholder for an AI hint system that provides suggestions for the next move, but it has not been fully implemented yet.

## How to Play:
1. Players take turns selecting their pieces and moving them according to the standard rules of checkers.
2. Pieces can be moved forward diagonally to an empty square, or they can capture an opponent's piece by jumping over it.
3. When a piece reaches the last row, it is promoted to a king and gains the ability to move backward.
4. The game ends when one player captures all of the opponent's pieces.

## Issues:
- The AI feature for suggesting moves is not fully functional and has not been implemented correctly.
